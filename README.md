## Project Structure

The hands on project on COVID19 Data Analysis using Python is divided into following tasks:
*  Task 1: Introduction
        The datasets that will be used, and the question we will answer with our analysis. 
*  Task 2: Importing COVID19 dataset 

      Import COVID19 dataset and prepare it for the analysis by dropping columns and aggregating rows.

      Decide on and calculate a good measure for our analysis.
*  Task 4: Importing World happiness report dataset 

      Import World happiness report dataset, dropping useless columns and Merge it with COVID19 dataset to find correlations among our data.
*  Task 5: Visualizing the results
